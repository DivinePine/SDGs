# Source

Please see the (main README)[../README.md] file for information on source of the goals, targets, and indicators.

# Script

The [build.py] script was built under Python `2.7.10`. It reads in the lists of [goals](../SDG-goals.csv), [targets](../SDG-targets.csv), and [indicators](../SDG-indicators_proposed-2016-03-24.csv), and combines them into various structured JSON files.

# Output

## `SDG-list.json`

## `SDG-dict.json`
